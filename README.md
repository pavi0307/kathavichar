# 📚 KathaVichar

_A multilingual storytelling assistant that helps users generate folk stories from image prompts using Streamlit._

---

## 🧩 What the App Does

KathaVichar allows users to select regional/cultural images (like Charminar, village festivals, etc.), and write stories inspired by them in Telugu, Hindi, or English. It saves these stories along with the selected image name and timestamp. This makes it useful for preserving folk tales, promoting regional languages, and sparking creativity.
