## 🗣️ Feedback Summary

As part of testing the KathaVichar app, we shared the prototype with a few peers and regional language users who tried generating stories in Telugu and Hindi. Here’s a summary of the feedback we received:

- 💡 Users found the image-based storytelling concept engaging and said it helped them think creatively.
- 🌍 The multilingual output was appreciated, especially for regional storytelling in Telugu.
- 🖼️ Some users suggested adding more culturally diverse image prompts to increase variety.
